<h4> Hi! </h4>

<p>I’m a Chicago-based analytics specialist with nearly <em>2 decades (!)</em> of experience. I love, love, love all things data, especially data visualizations. I’m in awe of anyone who can turn complex information into something elegant and intuitive. I'm always inspired by the passionate data experts dedicated to making the world more understandable.</p>

<p>Some of my favorite data things to do:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Helping people bridge the gap and understand each other through data.</li>
  <li>Experimentation, especially proving a long-held assumption wrong (or sometimes right!) via an a/b test.</li>
  <li>Learning new things. Right now it's D3 and advanced CSS and JavaScript!</li>
  <li>I am unboundedly curious, with a million questions. I love getting lost in the data trying to find answers  and seeing what other rabbit-holes I'm led down.</li>
</ul>

<p>While this may end up mostly being a collection of my work and learnings, I'll try to share some tips and tricks and deep-dives into some rad data things. I'm in no way an expert &mdash; I've made many, many mistakes and am eager to share the lessons I've learned!</p>
